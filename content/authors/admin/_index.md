## Hi there, I'm Moritz!

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Julia Vogt and Prof. Bjoern Menze. 
My research is motivated by the desire to understand the inner workings of machine learning models and leveraging this extracted knowledge to guide their behavior. To this end, I design interpretable methods that provide insights into the decision-making process of machine learning models, with a focus on visual perception. Subsequently, I work on incorporating domain knowledge into generative models to improve the steerability of generations.

So far, my research has been honored with a Spotlight at NeurIPS, and an Oral and Spotlight at ICLR and ICML workshops, respectively. Additionally, I am recipient of the Willi-Studer Prize for the best master's degree in Statistics.
