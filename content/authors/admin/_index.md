    summary: |
      My research focuses on:
      - Developing Interpretable Machine Learning methods that provide human-understandable explanations of their behavior. 
      - Designing Generative Methods, based on Diffusion Models and VAEs, that incorporate structural constraints, such as an internal hierarchy, into the generative process.
      - Improving Object Detection in Computer Vision by aligning instance-wise feature selection in images with human-like object perception to better reflect how we process visual information.

## Hi there, I'm Moritz!

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Julia Vogt and Prof. Bjoern Menze. 
My research is motivated by the desire to understand the inner workings of machine learning models and leveraging this extracted knowledge to guide their behavior. To achieve the first objective, I design interpretable methods that provide insights into the decision-making process of machine learning models, with a focus on computer vision. For the second, I incorporate domain knowledge into generative models to improve the steerability of generations.

So far, my research has been honored with a [Spotlight at NeurIPS]({{< relref "/publications/manduchi-2023-tree" >}}), and an [Oral]({{< relref "/publications/vandenhirtz-2024-sctree" >}}) and [Spotlight]({{< relref "/publications/vandenhirtz-2023-signal" >}}) at ICML and ICLR workshops, respectively. Additionally, I am recipient of the Willi-Studer Prize for the best master's degree in Statistics.
