title: 'Two decades of active surveillance for prostate cancer in a single-center
  cohort: favorable outcomes after transurethral resection of the prostate'


abstract: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. Active surveillance—repeated measurements of prostate specific antigen, digital rectal examination, and prostate biopsies—is an alternative treatment option to active therapy, such as radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, for patients with low grade prostate cancer. It aims to reduce overtreatment and negative side effects of active treatment. However, long-term outcome data is rare. As we prospectively collected data since the beginning of active surveillance in our clinic in 1999, our study provides insights into long-term outcomes after two decades of active surveillance.
